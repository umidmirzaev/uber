## Description

### Objective

This project aims to build a robust data pipeline and utilize diverse technologies for Uber data analysis. It involves API integration for data retrieval, dimension modeling, an open-source data pipeline tool, and the utilization of Google Cloud Platform. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive dashboard that offers valuable insights into Uber taxi trip data in NYC.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from NYC OpenData and contains trip records from yellow taxis in NYC for the period of January to June 2016. These records are submitted by Technology Service Providers (TSPs), including Uber, Lyft, and others, operating in New York City. The dataset includes information such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts.
